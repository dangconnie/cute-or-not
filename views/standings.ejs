<!-- How to calculate standings? Sum up number of votes for each direction. Below might not work because we are summing "up", "down" and "meh". Query below works if you used 1 or -1 to count votes: -->

	<!-- SELECT images.id, images.imageUrl, images.description, COUNT(votes.voteDirection) AS totalvotes FROM votes
		INNER JOIN images ON images.id = votes.imageID
		GROUP BY votes.imageID; -->

	<!-- Put it into groups before we can sum (GROUP BY). Everything with a unique imageID will be put into the same group. So it will sum everything for group 1, group 2 and group 3. -->


<!-- 
Count: # of rows (yes, no, meh)
Sum: sum of (1 or -1) -->

<!-- WHERE works on rows. HAVING works on groups. -->
